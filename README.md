# Bilamina_Analytical_Simulation
This MATLAB script models a composite laminateâ€™s cure cycle by reading an experimental temperature profile, computing degree of cure, glass-transition temperature, evolving thermo-mechanical properties, thickness change, curvature, and final deflection, and compares the predicted deflection with experimental measurements.
